                   Operation Sindoor was a series of air strikes conducted by India in May 2025, targeting terrorist launchpads and infrastructure within Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoJK), in response to a terrorist attack in Pahalgam. The operation was notable for its precision strikes, use of advanced indigenous technology, and a strategic shift in India's approach to cross-border counter-terrorism operations.

                <h2>Cricket</h2>
                <p> Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players. It involves batting, bowling, and fielding on a large field with a rectangular pitch at the center. The game originated in England and is now popular worldwide, especially in countries like India, Pakistan, Australia, and South Africa. 
                    Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. The field is oval with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12 metres) by 10 feet (3.04 metres) wide. Two sets of three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch. Across the top of each wicket lie horizontal pieces called bails. The sides take turns at batting and bowling (pitching); each turn is called an “innings” (always plural). Sides have one or two innings each, depending on the prearranged duration of the match, the object being to score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering the ball with a straight arm, try to break (hit) the wicket with the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several ways that the batsman is dismissed, or put out. A bowler delivers six balls at one wicket (thus completing an “over”), then a different player from his side bowls six balls to the opposite wicket. The batting side defends its wicket.
